To manually update the operating system using the `softwareupdate` tool, follow these steps:

1. List all available updates:
    ```sh
    softwareupdate --list
    ```
2. Install all available updates:
    ```sh
    sudo softwareupdate --install
    ```

        If you want to upgrade selected packages only, use the following command:
        ```sh
        softwareupdate --install package-name
        ```
