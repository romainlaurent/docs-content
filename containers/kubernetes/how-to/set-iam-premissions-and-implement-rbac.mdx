Role-based access control (RBAC) is a ntive feature of Kubernetes and a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your Organization.
The feature is activated on Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos by default and is compatible with Scaleway's IAM service. 
IAM and RBAC work together by integrating the cloud provider's identity and access management with Kubernetes' native RBAC system. This integration ensures that access permissions are consistent across both the cloud infrastructure and the Kubernetes cluster, providing a secure access control mechanism.
It allows you to assign roles to users, groups or `ServicesAccount` via `RoleBindings` and `ClusterRoleBindings`.

Key components of RBAC in Kubernetes include:

- **Roles and ClusterRoles:**
   - **Roles:** These are specific to a namespace and define a set of permissions for resources within that namespace (e.g., pods, services).
   - **ClusterRoles:** These are similar to roles but apply cluster-wide, spanning across all namespaces.
- **RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings:**
   - **RoleBindings:** These associate a set of permissions defined in a Role with a user, group, or service account within a specific namespace.
   - **ClusterRoleBindings:** These associate a set of permissions defined in a ClusterRole with a user, group, or service account across the entire cluster.
- **Subjects:**
   - A subject in RBAC can be a user, a group, or a service account to which roles or cluster roles are bound.
- **Rules:**
   - Rules are sets of permissions associated with roles or cluster roles. They specify what actions are allowed or denied on specific resources.

## Built-in IAM Permissions

### KubernetesSystemMastersGroupAccess

The `KubernetesSystemMastersGroupAccess` permission grants users the ability to manage and modify user groups within the Kubernetes system. Users with this permission can create, update, and delete user groups, which are essential for organizing and controlling access within the cluster.

### KubernetesFullAccess

The `KubernetesFullAccess` permission provides access rights to users within the Kubernetes system. It includes permissions for managing namespaces, pods, services, deployments, and other critical resources. Users with `KubernetesFullAccess` have the capability to perform various administrative tasks across the entire cluster.

## Cluster role "scaleway:cluster-write"

The `scaleway:cluster-write` cluster role is a custom role that grants users write access to certain cluster-level resources. It is essential to understand the specific permissions associated with this role to ensure users can perform necessary operations without granting unnecessary privileges.
To view the details of this cluster role, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get clusterrole scaleway:cluster-write -o yaml
```

Review the permissions listed in the YAML output to understand the scope of actions allowed by this role.
